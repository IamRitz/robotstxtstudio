# Completed Milestones

## Architecture & Setup
Commit: `d976fbb`
Delivered: Next.js 15 + TS strict + Tailwind v4 scaffold, feature-based structure, Vitest/Playwright harness, ESLint feature-boundary rule.
See: [`README.md`](../README.md)

## Product Documentation
Commit: `c76acbc`
Delivered: canonical PRD, design-system extraction, captured approved screens.
See: [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md), [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)

## Domain Models
Commit: `1030478`
Delivered: pure `src/types` vocabulary (RobotsFile, Crawler, Validation, Score, …) + Zod boundary schemas.
See: [`PRD.md` §15](./PRD.md)

## Parser
Commit: `af00e06`
Delivered: shared robots.txt parser → canonical AST; lossless `directives` backbone; tolerant recovery; 56 tests (~98%).
See: [`PARSER.md`](./PARSER.md)

## Validator
Commit: `8ee2d5a`
Delivered: 19-rule validation engine (critical/warning/recommendation), AI crawler checks, reusable health scoring; 100% domain coverage.
See: [`VALIDATOR.md`](./VALIDATOR.md)

## Explainer
Commit: `9ff36fb`
Delivered: deterministic plain-English explanations (groups, AI crawlers, sitemaps, notes); reuses Validator AI statuses; ~98% coverage.
See: [`EXPLAINER.md`](./EXPLAINER.md)

## URL Tester
Commit: `92f321c`
Delivered: canonical access-evaluation engine (group selection, longest-match + Allow-tie precedence, `*`/`$` wildcards); `testUrl` with trace + reason; trace-free `evaluateAccess`/`isAllowed` for reuse; ~99% coverage.
See: [`TESTER.md`](./TESTER.md)

# Current Sprint

**Goal:** Implement the Generator — turn a `GeneratorConfig` into a robots.txt.

**Scope:** `src/features/generator/` (pure domain). Map starter templates + per-crawler
policies + disallow paths + sitemap/crawl-delay → a `RobotsFile`, then serialize to
text. Reuse the Tester (`evaluateAccess`) for a live "what this blocks" preview. Unit
tests + `docs/GENERATOR.md`.

**Acceptance Criteria:** consumes `GeneratorConfig`; produces a valid `RobotsFile` +
serialized text; deterministic; round-trips through the parser; no React/Next;
≥80% coverage.

**Dependencies:** Domain Models ✅, Parser ✅, Validator ✅, Tester ✅ (all satisfied).

# Next Recommended Phase

**Generator (Phase 7).**

- **Why:** the first *producer* of a `RobotsFile`. It closes the loop — output can be
  immediately validated, explained, and tested with the engines already built — and
  unblocks the AI Manager (which composes generator output) and the Analyzer's
  "Fix Issues" flow.
- **Dependencies already satisfied:** `GeneratorConfig` model, the parser (for
  round-trip verification), and the Validator/Tester (for previews) all exist.

---

# Open Decisions

- **Branding / logo direction** — name locked to "Robots.txt Studio"; visual identity/logo deferred.
- **Future monitoring** — `MonitoredSite`/snapshots modeled but not scheduled/built.
- **Future team/workspace support** — accounts, multi-site, shareable reports (PRD §18).
- **LLM-assisted explanations** — optional layer on top of the deterministic baseline (PRD §18).

---

# Technical Debt

- **Design token migration** — Phase 1 `globals.css` uses an HSL blue `--primary`; migrate to the OKLCH neutral base + `--brand`/status tokens in UI Integration (DESIGN_SYSTEM §2).
- **Crawler dataset** — Validator/Explainer hardcode 5 major AI crawlers + a small label map; move to the config-layer crawler DB in the AI Manager phase.
- **Playwright e2e** — smoke spec written but not executed (browsers not installed); wire up in Testing phase.
- **Parser convenience fields** — `crawlDelay`/`host` are first-wins; duplicates live in `directives` (validator must scan). Documented in PARSER.md.
